        [Comissions:]

  If you like my work and decided that you want an original piece made by me, follow the next steps :</p>
<p>
  1-Contact.
  Reach out to me in any of <Link to="/LinksOut" target="_blank" >these platforms</Link> or via mail to <a href="mailto:vicdraws@gmail.com?subject=Art!" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> vicdraws@gmail.com</a> and tell me you want to commission me and what kind of piece do you want made (is it an icon? a fullbody with background?). Be patient and polite, I will answer every request!</p>
  <p>
  2-Pricing
  Once you tell me what you want we will accord on a price based on the price chart (see below). You will pay 50% of the price up front and I will start to work on your piece. I won't accept payment unless I'm absolutely certain I have the time and will to do the job. Also, I won't start working unless the first payment is done. Payments are done via<a href="https://ko-fi.com/vicdraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ko-fi </a> </p>

  3-Process.
  As soon as it is finished, you will receive watermarked detailed lineart so you can see how the piece is comming along . This is the stage to sugest changes in pose, details, etc. Once the revisions are made I start the coloring process. </p>

  <p>
  4-Final steps.
  Once the art is done, you'll be notified and then you'll pay the other 50% of the price, completing the payment in full. You'll get your final piece in the formats of your preference.</p>

  <p>
  5- In adition!:
If there are mistakes in the coloring (wrong colors, skin tones too light or too dark, ambient light not working properly) I'll change it promptly and without cost.Any other revisions after this point will come with an aditional cost though, so I encourage you to make use of the revision stages. 
</p>
<p>
Oh! and another thing!:
If you don't want me to showcase your art in social media, please let me know. We artist need these platforms to grow and work. Also, it would be amazing of you to share my work with propper credit and even links. I would be thankful from the bottom of my heart.     </p>
<p>
If you are now inclined to hire my work, I kindly remind you to be present in the platform we are interacting so I can get in touch with you quickly. 
I hope we can work together in the best of terms! </p>
